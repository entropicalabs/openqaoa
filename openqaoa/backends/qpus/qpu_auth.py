            in "-qvm" will return a QVM. Names ending in "-pyqvm" will return a

            An optional flag to force construction of a QVM (instead of a QPU).

            be returned regardless of the name's suffix.

            and set to ``True``, a quantum computer with a noise model will be 
            returned regardless of the name's suffix. The generic QVM noise 
            model is simple T1 and T2 noise plus readout error. See

            QCS hardware QPU.
        compiler_timeout: float
            Time limit for compilation requests, in seconds.
        execution_timeout: float
            Time limit for execution requests, in seconds.
        client_configuration: QCSClientConfiguration
            Optional client configuration. If none is provided, a default one 
            will be loaded.
        endpoint_id: str
            Optional quantum processor endpoint ID, as used in the 
            `QCS API Docs`_.
        engagement_manager: EngagementManager
            Optional engagement manager. If none is provided, a default one will
