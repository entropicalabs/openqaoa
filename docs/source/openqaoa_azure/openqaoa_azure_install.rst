OpenQAOA Azure Installation
===========================

Install via PyPI
----------------

You can install the latest version of openqaoa-azure directly from PyPi. We recommend creating a virtual environment with ``python>=3.8`` first and then simply pip install openqaoa-azure with the following command.

**NOTE:** Installing ``openqaoa-azure`` installs ``openqaoa-core`` and ``openqaoa-qiskit`` by default

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install openqaoa-azure

Installation instructions for Developers
----------------------------------------
OpenQAOA-Azure does not yet support developer install as a standalone package. If you wish to work in developer mode, please install the entire library. Instructions are available [here]()

Should you face any issue during the installation, please drop us an email at openqaoa@entropicalabs.com or open an issue!
