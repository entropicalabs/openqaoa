OpenQAOA Metapackage Installation
=================================
.. _openqaoa:

The following instructions install OpenQAOA along with all optional plugins

OpenQAOA is divided into separately installable plugins based on the requirements of the user. The core elements of the package are placed in ``openqaoa-core`` which comes pre-installed with each flavour of OpenQAOA.

Currently, OpenQAOA supports the following backends and each can be installed exclusively with the exception of ``openqaoa-azure`` which installs ``openqaoa-qiskit`` as an additional requirement because Azure backends support circuit submissions via `qiskit`.

- ``openqaoa-braket`` for AWS Braket
- ``openqaoa-azure`` for Microsoft Azure Quantum
- ``openqaoa-pyquil`` for Rigetti Pyquil
- ``openqaoa-qiskit`` for IBM Qiskit

The OpenQAOA metapackage allows you to install all OpenQAOA plug-ins together.
