OpenQAOA Core Installation
==========================
Choose this barebones installation if you do not wish to run computations on any specific cloud providers. With this install you can 
run QAOA on local Entropica simulators, namely, ``vectorized`` and ``analytical_simulator``.

Install via PyPI
----------------

You can install the latest version of openqaoa-core directly from PyPi. We recommend creating a virtual environment with ``python>=3.8`` first and then simply pip install openqaoa-core with the following command.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install openqaoa-core


Installation instructions for Developers
----------------------------------------

OpenQAOA-Core does not yet support developer install as a standalone package. If you wish to work in developer mode, please install the entire library. Instructions are available [here]()

Should you face any issue during the installation, please drop us an email at openqaoa@entropicalabs.com or open an issue!
