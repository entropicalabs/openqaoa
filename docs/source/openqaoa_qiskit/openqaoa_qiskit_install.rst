OpenQAOA Qiskit Installation
============================

Install via PyPI
----------------

You can install the latest version of openqaoa-qiskit directly from PyPi. We recommend creating a virtual environment with ``python>=3.9`` first and then simply pip install openqaoa-qiskit with the following command.

**NOTE:** Installing ``openqaoa-qiskit`` installs ``openqaoa-core`` by default

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install openqaoa-qiskit

Installation instructions for Developers
----------------------------------------

OpenQAOA-Qiskit does not yet support developer install as a standalone package. If you wish to work in developer mode, please install the entire library. Instructions are available :ref:`here <openqaoa>`

Should you face any issue during the installation, please drop us an email at openqaoa@entropicalabs.com or open an issue!
