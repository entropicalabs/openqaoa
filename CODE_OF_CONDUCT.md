# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of creating and growing an open, welcoming and positive environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation
in our projects and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for the
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback and criticism
* Focusing on what is best for our community and contributors
* Valuing the contributions of all participants
* Fostering and engaging in collaboration

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The maintainers of the projects are responsible for clarifying our standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate. Maintainers also have the right and responsibility to 
ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they 
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, both online and offline, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project and community team at openqaoa@entropicalabs.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and will result in a response 
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project and community team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies and guidelines may be posted separately.
