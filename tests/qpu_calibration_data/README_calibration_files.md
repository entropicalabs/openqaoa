The calibration data files in this folder are used for SPAM Twirling, an error mitigation technique which removes any preferred direction due to readout noise. The correct file format is a json with "exp_tags" (experiment tags which contain the metadata for the run such that time, name, id and number of qubits), "input_parameters" (which contains information about the device and the twirling parameters for the particualr run), "register" (which is the mapping between the physical qubits and the measurent counts string, for example, the readout of the physical register 131 may be stored at the second position of each key at the measurement_outcomes dict) and "results" (which contains the measurement counts from the empty circuit, ideally over the whole device).
