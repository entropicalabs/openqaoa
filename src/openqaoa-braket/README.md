# OpenQAOA-Braket Plugin

OpenQAOA is a multi-backend python library for quantum optimization using QAOA
on Quantum computers and Quantum computer simulators. This package is part of a
set of OpenQAOA plug-ins that lets users run QAOA computations on AWS Braket
supported devices, and devices that support Amazon Braket circuits. Check out
OpenQAOA website
[https://openqaoa.entropicalabs.com/](https://openqaoa.entropicalabs.com/)

**OpenQAOA is currently in OpenBeta.**

Please, consider [joining our discord](https://discord.gg/ana76wkKBd) if you
want to be part of our community and participate in the OpenQAOA's development.

## Installation instructions

### Install via PyPI

You can install the latest version of openqaoa-braket directly from PyPi. We
recommend creating a virtual environment with `python>=3.9` first and then
simply pip install openqaoa-braket with the following command.

**NOTE:** Installing `openqaoa-braket` installs `openqaoa-core` by default

```bash
pip install openqaoa-braket
```

OpenQAOA-Braket does not yet support developer install as a standalone package.
If you wish to work in developer mode, please install the entire library.
