        Parameters
        ----------
        device_name: str
            The name of the desired quantum computer. This should correspond to
            a name returned by :py:func:`list_quantum_computers`. Names ending
            in "-qvm" will return a QVM. Names ending in "-pyqvm" will return a
            :py:class:`PyQVM`. Names ending in "-noisy-qvm" will return a QVM
            with a noise model. Otherwise, we will return a QPU with the given
            name.
        as_qvm: bool
            An optional flag to force construction of a QVM (instead of a QPU).
            If specified and set to ``True``, a QVM-backed quantum computer will
            be returned regardless of the name's suffix.
        noisy: bool
            An optional flag to force inclusion of a noise model. If specified
            and set to ``True``, a quantum computer with a noise model will be
            returned regardless of the name's suffix. The generic QVM noise
            model is simple T1 and T2 noise plus readout error. See
            :py:func:`~pyquil.noise.decoherence_noise_with_asymmetric_ro`. Note,
            we currently do not support noise models based on QCS hardware; a
            value of `True`` will result in an error if the requested QPU is a
            QCS hardware QPU.
        compiler_timeout: float
            Time limit for compilation requests, in seconds.
        execution_timeout: float
            Time limit for execution requests, in seconds.
        client_configuration: QCSClient
            Optional client configuration. If none is provided, a default one
            will be loaded.
        endpoint_id: str
            Optional quantum processor endpoint ID, as used in the
            `QCS API Docs`_.
        # engagement_manager: EngagementManager
        #     Optional engagement manager. If none is provided, a default one will
        #     be created.
