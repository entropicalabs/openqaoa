## Version v0.2.6 (July 10th, 2024)

This version brings two main changes:

### What's Changed
* QAOA workflows now support `evaluate_circuit` which lets compute the energy and measurement outcomes for a QAOA circuit for a specified set of parameter values. 
* The library design-wise is moving closer to modularization goal where each hardware provider backend can be installed independently (this feature is expected to fully functional in the next release)
* OpenQAOA v0.1.3 brings in a list of new optimization problems contributed by @alemonbar, including:
   * Maximal Independent Set (MIS)
   * Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
   * Bin Packing problem

## Version v0.1.2 (March 23rd, 2023)

There was a small bug in the code that resulted in qiskit circuit not compiling, resulting in erros on QPUs
* This bug was fixed
* Two additional unittests were added to test for compilation to avoid these errors in future.

## Version v0.1.1 (February 23rd, 2023)

This release brings the following new features:
* The ability to plug in custom qubit routing solutions for QAOA circuits.

### What's Changed

* Refactor
  * The new `GateMapLabel` introduces an updated and a more consistent way to label QAOA gates in the circuit. 
* New Features
  * OpenQAOA now supports specifying custom qubit routing algorithms in an expected format in the QAOA workflow. This is implemented in https://github.com/entropicalabs/openqaoa/pull/179


## Version v0.1.0 (February 17th, 2023)

This release brings major changes to the structure of OpenQAOA.
