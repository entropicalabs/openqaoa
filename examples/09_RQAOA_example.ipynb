The expectation values are then ranked according to their magnitude $|\\mathcal{M}_{(i,ij)}|$. In its original formulation, the highest ranked value is selected. This value is then utilized to eliminate a qubit from the Hamiltonian. This is done by first, performing integer rounding of the expectation value, i.e. $\\mathcal{M}_{(i,ij)} \\rightarrow \\textrm{sign}(\\mathcal{M}_{(i,ij)})$, then transforming the rounded value into a constraint on the respective\\ qubits\n",

    "and last, inserting the constraint into the Hamiltonian, effectively reducing the size of the problem by one qubit. Using the reduced Hamiltonian, QAOA is run again and the same procedure is followed. Once the reduced problem reaches a predefined cutoff size, it is solved exactly solved via classical methods. The final answer is then reconstructed by re-inserting the eliminated qubits into the classical solution following the appropriate order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of RQAOA is included in OpenQAOA. Additionally, OpenQAOA incorporates RQAOA from two different generalized version of these procedure, which enable multiple qubit eliminations during the recursive process. These strategies are denoted as `custom` and `adaptive`, in accordance with the precise concept under which the elimination method takes place. In a nutshell, they are described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``custom`` strategy allows the user to define the number of eliminations to be performed at each step. This defined by the parameter ``steps``. If the parameter is set as an integer, the algorithm will use this value as the number of qubits to be eliminated at each step. Alternatively, it is possible to pass a list, which specifies the number of qubits to be eliminated at each step. For ``steps = 1``, the algorithm reduces to the original form of RQAOA presented in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``adaptive`` strategy adaptively selects how many qubits to eliminate at each step. The maximum number of allowed eliminations is given by the parameter ``n_max``. At each step, the algorithm selects the top ``n_max+1`` expectation values (ranked in magnitude), computes the mean among them, and uses the ones lying above it for qubit elimination. This corresponds to a maximum of ``n_max`` possible elimination per step. For ``n_max= 1``, the algorithm reduces to the original form of RQAOA presented in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The specific performance of these generalizations is currently under investigation. In particular, the development of Adaptive RQAOA is associated with an internal research project at Entropica Labs to be released publicly in the near future [4]. We make these strategies already available to the community in order to strengthen the exploration of more complex elimination schemes for RQAOA, beyond its original formulation [1]."

    "First, the ``r.results['solution']`` dictionary contains to the final solution(s) of the problem, here ``1010101010`` (the antiferromagnetic solution we expected!), and the associated energy(-ies), here ``5.0``. The ``r.results['classical_output']`` dictionary contains the results from the classical optimization at the cutoff size. The ``r.results['elimination_rules']`` dictionary displays how qubits were eliminated throughout the recursive process. Taking the first entry ``{'pair': (0, 1), 'correlation': -1.0}`` as an example, it should be read as: qubit ``1`` was eliminated in favor of qubit ``0``, and the correlation between them is negative. When the label of the remaining qubit reads ``None``, like in ``{'singlet': (1,), 'bias': -1.0}``, the qubit ``1`` was not eliminated in favor of a remaining one, but was instead fixed to the specified value ``-1.0``, resulting from a single-qubit expectation value being the highest ranked. The ``r.results['schedule']`` corresponds to the number of eliminations that took place at each step. The ``r.results['intermediate_steps']`` is a list, each item is storing information of each recursive step of the RQAOA algorithm. Each item is a dictonary with a QUBO problem object (object storing the problem solved in the corresponding step), a QAOA result object (object storing the corresponding qaoa solutions after solving the QUBO problem), a list of the expectation values in z and the correlation matrix of the corresponding step. Finally, ``r.results['number_steps']`` tells us the number of steps that it took to reach the cutoff value and ``r.results['atomic_ids']`` gives us the identification for the QAOA objects that have been optimized in the process, we can ignore them for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``r.results`` object has some methods that help to get the intermediate steps: \n",
    "``.get_qaoa_results(step)``, ``.get_qaoa_optimized_angles(step)``, ``.get_problem(step)``, ``plot_corr_matrix(step)``, etc. (see documentation). Example:"

    "But wait! We claimed to be using the original form of RQAOA, where only one elimination takes place at each step. However, in the ``schedule`` we can observe that in the third, fourth and fifth step **two** qubits were eliminated instead of one. How is this possible? To clarify, the algorithm **did** select a single expectation value to generate a constraint and eliminate a single qubit form the model! This extra eliminations turn out to be an interesting property of the RQAOA. When one qubit is eliminated as a function of another, this corresponds to fusing two nodes in the underlying graph, making the reduced graph *denser*. On the contrary, when a qubit is fixed to a value, we effectively remove the node from the graph, thus making the reduced graph *sparser*. It turns out that the combination of these processes can sometimes lead to nodes getting isolated from the main graph component. This means that, if the assumptions we made (i.e. the imposed constraints) are correct, the specific value of this qubit is independent of the rest, and can then be fixed respecting the corresponding linear term (or arbitrarily if no linear term is present!). \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, spontaneous eliminations can take place as a result of fixing nodes that ended up isolated consequence of the topology changes throughout the elimination process. \n",
    "\n",
    "(**NOTE**: If you think about this carefully, you will notice that this event is mostly prominent in uniform-like graphs, where terms can cancel, but for randomly weighted problems, this will most likely not take place at all!)"

    "As presented in the introduction, the ``Custom`` strategy allows to generalize the number of eliminations at each step. The specific number of eliminations (up the spontaneous ones described in the previous section) can either be a constant value at each step, or we can set a custom schedule defining what to do at each step. Note that, when customizing a schedule, total number of eliminations need to be enough to reach the cutoff size! In general, the algorithm will choose to never go beyond the cutoff, e.g. if we ask for 5 qubits to be eliminated but we are 2 qubits away from the cutoff only 2 will be eliminated. The only exception to this is when spontaneous eliminations occur."

This corresponds to a fully-connected system, where we choose the couplings $J_{ij}$ to be of magnitude 1, but with a randomly assigned signs. The workflow requires us to define the problem as an instance of the ``QUBO`` class, which can be easily done by defining the connectivity of the problem as a set of tuples, and the and the associated weights (i.e. coupling constants) as a list. Here, we approach this problem using Adaptive RQAOA."
