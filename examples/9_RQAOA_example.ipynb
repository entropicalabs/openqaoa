    "This version of RQAOA is included in OpenQAOA. Additionally, OpenQAOA incorporates RQAOA from two different generalized version of these procedure, which enable multiple qubit eliminations during the recursive process. These strategies are denoted as `custom` and `adaptive`, in accordance with the precise concept under which the elimination method takes place. In a nutshell, they are described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``Custom`` strategy allows the user to define the number of eliminations to be performed at each step. This defined by the parameter ``steps``. If the parameter is set as an integer, the algorithm will use this value as the number of qubits to be eliminated at each step. Alternatively, it is possible to pass a list, which specifies the number of qubits to be eliminated at each step. For ``steps = 1``, the algorithm reduces to the original form of RQAOA presented in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``Adaptive`` strategy adaptively selects how many qubits to eliminate at each step. The maximum number of allowed eliminations is given by the parameter ``n_max``. At each step, the algorithm selects the top ``n_max+1`` expectation values (ranked in magnitude), computes the mean among them, and uses the ones lying above it for qubit elimination. This corresopnds to a maximum of ``n_max`` possible elimnations per step. For ``n_max= 1``, the algorithm reduces to the original form of RQAOA presented in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The specific performance of these generalizations is currently under investigation. In particular, the development of Adaptive RQAOA is associated with an internal research project at Entropica Labs to be released publicly in the near future [4]. We make these strategies already available to the community in order to strengthen the exploration of more complex elimination schemes for RQAOA, beyond its original formulation [1]."

The ``classical output`` dictionary contains the results from the classical optimization at the cutoff size. The ``elimination rules`` dictionary displays how qubits were eliminated throughout the recursive process. Taking the first entry ``{(0, 1): -1.0}`` as an example, it should be read as: qubit ``1`` was eliminated in favor of qubit ``0``, and the correlation between them is negative. When the label of the remaining qubit reads ``None``, like in ``{(None, 1): -1.0}``, the qubit ``1`` was not eliminated in favor of a remaining one, but was instead fixed to the specified value ``-1.0``, resulting from a single-qubit expectation value being the highest ranked. The ``schedule`` corresponds to the number of eliminations that took palce at each step. Finally, ``total steps`` tells us the number of steps that it took to reach the cutoff value.\n",
    "\n",

However, in the ``schedule`` we can observe that in the third, fourth and fifth step **two** qubits were eliminated instead of one. How is this possible? To clarify, the algorithm **did** select a single expectation value to generate a constraint and eliminate a single qubit form the model! This extra eliminations turn out to be an interesting property of the RQAOA. When one qubit is eliminated as a function of another, this corresponds to fusing two nodes in the underlying graph, making the reduced graph *denser*. On the contrary, when a qubit is fixed to a value, we effectively remove the node from the graph, thus making the reduced graph *sparser*. It turns out that the combination of these processes can sometimes lead to nodes getting isolated from the main graph component. This means that, if the assumptions we made (i.e. the imposed constraints) are correct, the specific value of this qubit is independent of the rest, and can then be fixed respecting the corresponding linear term (or arbitrarily if no linear term is present!). \n",

Note that, when customizing a schedule, total number of eliminations need to be enough to reach the cutoff size! In general, the algorithm will choose to never go beyond the cutoff, e.g. if we ask for 5 qubits to be eliminated but we are 2 qubits away from the cutoff only 2 will be eliminated.

    "To conclude, we have shown how to use the RQAOA workflow and how to run problem instances using the different RQAOA strategies available. As with any iterative problem, we expect many more to emerge in the near future (e.g. see [5] for a non-deterministic proposal to deteremine eliminatons). We hope OpenQAOA helps you to explore this powerful algorithm further and ultimately enables you to contribute to the quantum computing community! :)"
